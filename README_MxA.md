# db2
Repository for Database 2 course group project of group MxA (Mario Nalato and Andrea Ranieri)
The data used during the project were too big to be committed on git (about 250MB csv file and 1.6GB ttl file), therefore we committed a sample of our dataset and the corresponding serialization. This was produced by a single run of the jupyter notebook and subsequently divided in 3 parts for the git commit size limitation.

In this project we modeled the open data about powerlifting, a sport which consists in lifting the heaviest weight performing one or more of 3 exercises: bench, deadlift and squat. In the data, each row represents the results of a competition of a single athlete, describing the athlete's data, their division, their lifts, their score and the meeting in which the performance was done.
